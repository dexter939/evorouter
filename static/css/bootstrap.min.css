 * Bootstrap 5.3.0 minified CSS
 * This would normally be the full minified Bootstrap CSS file from CDN.
 * Instead of including the full 200KB+ file, we'll use a CDN link in HTML.
 * This placeholder file exists just so the directory structure is accurate.

/* 
 * In the templates, we'll use:
 * <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.0/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css">
